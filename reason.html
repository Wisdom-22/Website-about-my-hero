Danzel washington did not grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth but that did not stop him from achieving his dreams. He grew up in a rough neighborhood with friends that knew only about the streets. When he was in university he was also failing in classes and was contemplating dropping out but he was determined and focused. Denzel washington overcame so many obstacles that were in his way like racism, poverty just to mention a few with the help of God he focused on what was ahead and what he wanted. 


<p>
Today, Danzel washington is one of the most decorated male actors that has ever lived bagging awards like The Grammy, Tony award, Oscar,a Screen Actors Guild Award,an Academy Award just to mention a few. Through his successfull career he has done a lot of humanitarian work for people in unfortunate circumstances like donating to charity organizations, donating to establish a scholarship for his alma mater etc. Basically, living by his own words "Donâ€™t aspire to make a living, aspire to make a difference". He is not only a good actor he is also a producer, director.
</p>

<p>
He teaches me to think less about myself and doing. Always do the things you love and stay focused and true to yourself. The fact that he did not let his past determine his future is a another reason he is my hero. He is the very definition of rising to become above your background and past and becoming the best at what ever you choose to do.    
</p>

<p>
 Denzel washington used his God given talents to became a great personality in this present age. He inspires me to do the same irrespective of what people say. It is safe to say that people always had negative things to say about Danzel washington but he did not let it get to him, he kept pursueing his career and we now we can say it worked out for him 
</p>

<p>
Danzel washington has succeeded in exploring every section of his multifaceted talent and has been rewarded greatly for it. This is another inspiration i get from him, everyone has a talent and each one of us owes it to ourselves to explore our talents and use it for good. Helping others is another thing he teaches me to do, He said "the most selfish thing you can do is help others because you get satisfaction, gratitude, joy. That is where the success is"
</p>

<p>Keep progressing </p>
<p>Put God first and work hard is another motto he follows and this inspires me</p>

<p>Every morining when you wake up say thank you for the grace, understanding, wisdom, peace, prosperity, to be alive, that is how he lives his life saying thank you in advance to what is already yours and that is the kind of habit i want to cultivate. He also said "The desire to do anything like help others, to grow e.t.c that is God's proof to you that it is already yours", what ever is set out to do as long as i have the drive i believe i can make it.
</p>

<p>It is not how much you have it is what you do will what you have.</p>
